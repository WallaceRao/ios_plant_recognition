# ios_plant_recognition
simple ios app for plant recognition 

This is an IOS application used to recognise plant via google API.

NOTE: I know the code is NOT readable, because I borrowed one mac book for developing this app and I had to return it in one week, so I did not consider much about code rule or naming rule..... All I considered is efficiency.

In fact google Vision API could identify any objects in an image, so you are not limited to analyse plant images.

The main function:

1 Take photo, upload photo to google Vision servie, display the identification result.
2 Select one image from album, upload the image to google Vision servie, display the identification result.
3 A dictionary which contains introduction of some unique plants in NZ.

I will improve the code and add new features when I have a mac :)
